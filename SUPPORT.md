## Help and questions about this project: 

### üìã&ensp;Forum 

Our preferred method of communication is our forums on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/boocoda/boocoda-api/discussions). Asynchronous long-form discussion communication with minimal repetition. Maybe your question has already been answered there!

### üí¨&ensp;Chat 

Prefer the speed and fluidity of chat? Then join our [Telegram community](https://t.me/boocoda).

We think chat and forum discussions are [highly complementary](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/04/effectively-using-discourse-together-with-group-chat/), happily co-existing as two different modes of conversation. Try to use the right tool for the job, but most importantly, we just want to hear from you, regardless of the medium!
